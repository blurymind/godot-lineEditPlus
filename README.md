A line edit node with the ability to limit what characters can be entered via a Regular expression string and also limit how many characters can be entered.

For example 
- using [0-9] for the regexLimitString would allow only numbers to be entered
- using [A-Za-z ] for the regexLimitString would allow only letters to be entered

You can also limit how many characters can be entered via the maxCharacters int
